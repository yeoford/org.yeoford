  "editorial": "It ’ s June, which means the summer is officially here... There ’ s something quite wonderful about June...brighter skies, a glimmer of sunshine, warmer days, holidays approaching, it just oozes a sense of optimism and happiness. Lovely! Anyway, what ’ s been going on in village? Well, not a huge amount, the public rubbish bin has inexplicably been removed by the Council from outside the pub, meaning that there ’ s no public bin at that end of the village, which is a bit bizarre seeing as the other bins in the village still need emptying. Very odd. With the increased farm traffic travelling through the village, there has been more murmurings regarding the pitiful number of public footpaths in the area. It ’ s certainly not the first time that this has cropped up and looking at DCC ’ s interactive map, you can see there isn ’ t a lot around us despite the rolling countryside (www.devon.gov.uk/prow/interactive - map/). For those exploring how this can change, maybe speak to landowners directly or contact Parish, District or County Councillors … What else? Oh, some activity seems have occurred on the road surfacing front, which was much needed, especially up towards Punchbowl and other bits and pieces seem to be happening on the main Crediton road. Oh, the excitement! That ’ s about it, have a wonderful June (how couldn't you?!), enjoy the weather, look forward to the holidays if you ’ re having one and keep smiling... Cheers … The Editor",
