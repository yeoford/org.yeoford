  "editorial": "Spring is Definitely in the Air.. ...or are they muck - spreading again? Ho, ho! Well, it seems to be getting sunnier, and it ’ s definitely getting lighter, which can only be a good thing! By the time you read this, the evenings will be brighter and barbeques will be getting dusted down and de - spidered as the village crawls out from its almost bear - like winter hibernation slumber. Or something like that. Anyway, March, and what a month that was, with what appears to be the biggest ever Yeofest, which saw over 400 punters rock up to the village hall and pretty much drink the place dry. As ever, it was a herculean effort by the volunteers, both before, during and after and it also looks like being the biggest profits made ever, which go towards the upkeep of the hall and keeping costs low for the village user groups, of which more are very much welcomed. This month, there ’ s not a lot of specific events, but you ’ ll see inside, a lot is happening around and about, including a big request for volunteers to help tidy up the station to get it on par with all the other stations up and down the line. Being April, there ’ s the obligatory April Fool courtesy of Devon County Council on the front cover. They ’ re such a bunch of wags, eh?! Any, until next month, enjoy the ever increasing light... Cheers … The Editor",
