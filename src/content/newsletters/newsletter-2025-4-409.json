  "editorial": "It ’ s all about those Bank Holidays... Ah, it ’ s May already, and blimey it ’ s an absolute sea of colour out there, which really is quite uplifting! Not quite sure why the apple trees have blossomed so readily, but anyway, it ’ s all very pretty! Easter has come and gone, I hope you all had some suitably relaxing time off if you had the chance. The upcoming May Bank Holidays will mean most of us will get far too used to long weekends...ah well, enjoy them if you can...we may even get some decent weather! Not a lot ’ s been happening around and about other than the news that the County Councillor, Frank Letch, sadly passed away. As a familiar face around Crediton and wider, his presence will be missed. What else? Nothing major really...the Duck is open again after a well - earned break and will be opening on Wednesdays from the 7th May...and if you ’ re reading this in time, they are hoping to open on the May Day Bank Holiday, so get down there and commemorate spring celebrations and International Workers' Day...and maybe erect a Maypole, crown a May Queen, partake in some Morris dancing, or whatever else takes your fancy...although do ask the pub first! In other news, there ’ s no update on Yeoford Zoo, so we ’ ll have to wait for that. Cheers … The Editor",
