  "editorial": "Still wet out there... I could cut n paste from last month to blether on about the flooding and mud on the roads (what do you mean that ’ s what I always do?!), but I won ’ t because things are looking brighter! Literally! The days are getting lighter and longer and this year the clocks are going forward at the end of the month, which is always a bonus! Finally, we ’ ll crawl out of the quagmire of winter and towards the sunny demure of summer, hurrah! Anyway, what ’ s been going on in and around the village...well, not a huge amount, other than cursory glances towards Crediton to see how the Lidl and McDonalds developments are getting on, oh and the Leisure Centre is getting a changing room upgrade, so that ’ s pretty good news. Back over here, the roads are churning up again, so please make sure you identify any potholes via the DCC website. If you damage your car on one and it isn ’ t already on their system, they shirk their culpability very quickly. So March and that means Yeofest! Back at the hall for the 15th time on Saturday 15th March, we ’ ll have the usual raft of beer, cider, hot and cold food, rugby and music throughout the day. We ’ ve already gained a huge amount of lovely sponsors both locally and further afield who we ’ ll be thanking in next month ’ s issue — you know who you are!!! As ever, we ’ ll be expecting an influx of a lot of lovely punters from the trains (fingers firmly crossed for no problems!) to the village, so come and join the fun! Until next month... Cheers … The Editor",
